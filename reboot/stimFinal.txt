I was in the eighth grade,
and at that time 
I was in a very 
intense soccer program
that gears you towards 
playing well in highschool
and getting into college.

And I was on the 
travelling team,
and we were in
a tournament that 
was qualifying 
for nationals,
and it was the
final game.

And by the time 
that I went in
to play, we were down 
one to nothing.

And I was very small 
as an eighth grader, 
especially for
one playing soccer. 

So I finally 
got to go in
and I was playing
my heart out, but
I have asthma and
it was very hot.

So I was already 
exhausted and 
struggling just to
even keep up anymore,
when finally 
I got the ball 
and had a one-on-one 
shot with the goalie.
And I went to go shoot,
and the goalie, 
who was a much larger 
human being than 
I was at the time,
took me out by 
both ankles, to
prevent me from 
shooting.

And I went down, 
and both bones 
in my forearm, 
the radius and 
the ulna flexed 
outwards, so one of 
my arm was physically
shorter than the 
other one, because 
of the damage 
to the bone.

And the medic 
at the tournament 
was busy on 
another field.
So I had to lay 
there on the ground, 
holding my own wrist 
for about fifteen 
minutes until the
medic was available.

And in the disctraction
of the play, the 
referee did not 
count the goal.
So the game ended,
my team lost, and
I had to sit on
the field for about 
fifteen minutes, 
holding a broken arm.

 NEXT STORY

I was about
six years old,
and my brother 
was going away 
to this 
sleepover camp,
and I really 
wanted to go,
because I wanted 
to hang out 
with my brother.
I wanted 
to be cool, 
I wanted to
show my parents 
that I am old 
enough to do 
these fun things.

So we went 
to this camp.
We got there, 
and my brother
looked at me and said:
"Just so you know,
we don't know 
each other this week.
I don't know you, 
we've never met."

So my heart fell 
to the floor.
This was not the week 
I was expecting.
And so I had 
this horrible week,
I couldn't make friends,
I was really struggling,
I missed home and 
had all these problems.

And there was a 
huge climbing wall
right in the center 
of the camp.
And in the second 
to last day,
I wanted to climb 
this climbing wall.
I told myself: 
"This is so fun,
I can do this."

So I got up there, 
to about halfway up 
the climbing tower,
and I made the mistake 
of looking down.
I completely panicked. 
My heart was pumping 
out of my chest,
I started to get dizzy.
I said: "I can't do this.
I am not going to 
be able to climb this tower, 
I just have to live
the rest of my life 
in the middle of this 
climbing tower in this camp."

So they were calling 
at me from the bottom,
telling me to come down.
And I told them that 
I couldn't come down.
And they knew I had 
my brother there 
and went to get him.
I think he was 
at archery 
or something.

And I suddenly 
heard him calling 
at me from the bottom,
telling me that 
I had to come down. 
He said: 
"I know you can do this! 
You are the best!"
And I said: 
"I'm not, 
I can't do it! 
I'm scared!"

And he yelled up to me: 
"I know that I
don't say this enough,
but you are the strongest, 
bravest little kid, 
I am so proud of you!
Sometimes, when I say 
that I don't want people 
to know who you are, 
it's because I am jealous 
of how fun and fearless
you are. I love you,
and I know you can do this!"

And you know,
I was the little 
child, whose brother
had always made her 
feel like this brat 
who was just around.
And this was the first 
time that I felt
that my brother 
really loved me
and believed in me.
So I started to head 
down the tower,
but he yelled at me: 
"No, you can do this!
Climb all the way 
to the top!"

So I climbed all 
the way to the top 
of the tower and 
it felt amazing. 
Then I got down there,
and at this point
a lot of the camp 
had assembled
at the bottom 
of the tower. 
I guess it made 
a bit of a scene.
And I got to the bottom
and he gave me 
this big hug,
looked at me 
and said:
"Never forget that 
I think you are the 
greatest little kid ever."
